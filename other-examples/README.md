KeyAuth Python Examples

**merged_example.py**

Yes title says everything. This file contains the `keyauth.py` and `main.py` from https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example

A few people did not know how to merge the files, so I made an example.

**method1.py**

This file shows you how to add your program to keyauth example.

All you have to do is copy and paste your code below the example, you can check it in the `method1.py` file.

**method2.py**

This file shows you how to use your code if it's above the example code.

- This method will only work if you call your functions after login.
- **Example:**
Create 1 function that will call all the other needed functions. You can also create 1 function and put everything in it. This is all your choice, method 1 would be a better idea.
- This can be exploited with Python code injection, for example injecting a code that will call the function before login.
